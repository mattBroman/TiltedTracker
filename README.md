# TiltedTracker
Inspired by the reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/9223l3/i_came_up_with_a_formula_to_estimate_ones_elo_and/ by /u/eaglessoar, FortniteTracker.com, bordoem, and Memes, I decided to rank my friends who I played Fortnight with. While doing all of the statical calculation required in to do so, I came to the realization that this could be done via web application and decieded to do so. My friend said he'd help me so we're going for it. Big thanks to all of those listed above.
